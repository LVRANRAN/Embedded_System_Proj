# Embedded_System_Proj(“Embedded Fitness” Challenge)

## Objective:
The COVID pandemic has forced almost all gyms to close until further notice. Because
of this, many of us have become sedentary and are suffering from lack of sufficient
exercise causing fatigue and obesity creating the need for new exercising options. The
objective of this semester’s embedded challenge is to use the data collected from a
single accelerometer (on your microcontroller board) to record body movements to
identify one of 4 exercises: Situps, Pushups, Jumping Jacks, Squats
* The device must be able to detect all 4 exercises and can be placed anywhere
on the body.
* You must use some indication method (4 LEDs?) to specify that a specific
exercise has occurred and must keep count for all four exercises.
* You must program a fixed workout routine, 15 repetitions of each exercise for
example. There must be some indication of the workout progress and if it has
been “completed”.
* Be creative and use the LEDs, buttons, etc. in a way that makes the user
interface friendly and useful.
